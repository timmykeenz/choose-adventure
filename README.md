# Welcome
This game was built in Unity using C# scripting.  All code was created by Timothy Keenan.  Models, lighting, and materials were built by Seth Milligan.  This was our first attempt at building a game in Unity.  This was a great learning experience as we gained knowledge about the Unity physics engine and built logic for levels.  Custom algorithms were designed and built to allow for seamless music transitions, calculate physics when the player moves on slopes, and keep track of the player's decisions throughout the game.

# Choose Your Adventure
The idea of the game is to allow the player freedom in the choices they make.  There is a game manager that actively watches the player progress and dynamically adjusts the level design accordingly.  It is a simple, yet powerful concept that can branch out into unique gameplay.
